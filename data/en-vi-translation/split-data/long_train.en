Do you remember when we used to go up to Kiteflyer's Hill ? Those summer nights , so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said Some nights I think of you and then I go up on Kiteflyer's Hill wrapped up against the winter chill And somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and I wonder if ever just briefly do I creep in your dreams now and then Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Have the years been kind ? And do you think of me sometimes up on Kiteflyer's Hill ? Oh , I pray you one day will We won't say a word We won't need them Sometimes silence is best We'll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Do you think of me sometimes ? And do you ever make that climb ? Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Have the years been kind ? And do you ever make that climb up on Kiteflyer's Hill ? Kiteflyer's ... [ French ] Where are you ? Where are you now ? Where are you now ? Kiteflyer's ... Gracias . Thank you very much .

Slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds . Standing at the center of time as it uncurls . Cutting through the veil of illusion . Moving beyond past conclusions . Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere right now , I would want to be here . Searching for the future among the things we're throwing away . Trying to see the world through the junk we produce everyday . They say nothing lasts forever , but all the plastic ever made is still here . And no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere in history , I would want to be here . The Romans , the Spanish the British , the Dutch , American exceptionalism , so out of touch . The folly of empire repeating its course , imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time . But the world can't take it very much longer . We're not going to make it unless we're smarter and stronger . The world is going to shake itself free of our greed somehow . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere in time , if I could be anywhere and change things , it would have to be now . They say nothing last forever , but all the plastic ever made is still here . And no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear . And the world can't take it very much longer . We're not going to make it unless we're smarter and stronger . The world's gonna shake itself free of our greed somehow . And the world can't take it , that you can see . If the oceans don't make it , neither will we . The world's gonna shake itself all the way free somehow . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere in time , if I could be anywhere and change the outcome , it would have to be now . Thank you .
Feminists don't have a sense of humor . Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo , hoo , hoo . Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors . They have a tumor on their funny bone . They say child molestation isn't funny -- ha , ha , ha , ha . Rape and degradation's just a crime -- lighten up , ladies . Rampant prostitution's sex for money -- what's wrong with that ? Can't these chicks do anything but whine ? Dance break ! Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . Woo-hoo ! Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da -- yeah , take it off . Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , dum . They say cheap objectification isn't witty -- it's hot ! Equal work and wages worth the fight -- sing us a new one . On-demand abortion every city -- OK , but no gun control . Won't these women ever get a life ? Feminists don't have a sense of humor -- poor Hillary . Feminists and vegetarians -- make mine a Big Mac . Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors . They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham , that's why these feminists just need to find a man . Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . I'm Dennis Kucinich and I approved this message .
Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama . Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory , I know the truth in your smile , I know the truth in your smile , piercing through the gloom of my ignorance . Oh , there is a mama lying down sleeping you're very ill and your heart crying . Wondering , wondering , wondering , wondering where is this world coming to . Is it right the children have to fend for themselves ? No , no , no , no , no. no . Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady's head ? So unlucky faceless people . Thula Mama Mama , Thula Mama . Thula Mama Mama . Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama Mama , Thula Mama Tomorrow it's going to be better . Tomorrow it's going to be better to climb , Mama . Thula Mama , Thula Mama . Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour . And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby . Should I now stop singing of love , now that my memory's surrounded by blood ? Sister , why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer ? So who are they who says , no more love poems now ? I want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child . Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile that will ignite my love song , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life . Ooh , I've not tried to run away from song , I hear a persistent voice , more powerful than the enemy bombs . The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood . My song of love and my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love -- I want everybody to sing with me -- my song of life , my song of love , my song of life -- everybody sing with me -- my song of life , my song of love -- I can't hear you -- my song of love , my song of life -- you can do better -- my song of life , my song of love -- keep singing , keep singing -- my song of love , my song of life , yes , my song of love -- you can do better than that -- my song of life , yes , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love -- keep singing , keep singing , keep singing -- my song of love . Oh yeah . My song of -- a love song , my song of life . Sing . A love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Love song , my song of life .
I'm not joking , you know , this stage fright is real . And if I'm up here trembling and singing , well , you'll know how I feel . And the mistake I'd be making , the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking . As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me , well , you don't have to be . Well , maybe just a little bit . And maybe I'll try to imagine you all without clothes . But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows . Not to discuss this at length , but my body image was never my strength . So frankly , I wish that you all would get dressed , I mean , you're not even really naked . And I'm the one with the problem . And you tell me , don't worry so much , you'll be great . But I'm the one living with me and I know how I get . Your advice is gentle but late . If not just a bit patronizing . And that sarcastic tone doesn't help me when I sing . But we shouldn't talk about these things right now , really , I'm up on stage , and you're in the crowd . Hi . And I'm not making fun of unnurtured , irrrational fear , and if I wasn't ready to face this , I sure as hell wouldn't be here . But if I belt one note out clearly , you'll know I'm recovering slowly but surely . And maybe next week , I'll set my guitar ringin' my voice clear as water , and everyone singin' . But probably I'll just get up and start groovin' , my vocal cords movin' , at speeds slightly faster than sound .
It's nine o' clock on a Saturday The record store's closed for the night So I fire up the old iTunes music store And soon I am feelin' all right I know Steve Jobs can find me a melody With one dollar pricing that rocks I can type in the track and get album names back While still in my PJs and socks Sell us a song , you're the music man My iPod's still got 10 gigs to go Yes , we might prefer more compatibility But Steve likes to run the whole show I heard " Desperate Housewives " was great last night But I had a bad piece of cod As I threw up my meal , I thought , " It's no big deal " I'll watch it tonight on my' Pod And now all of the networks are joining in Two bucks a show without ads It's a business those guys always wanted to try But only Steve Jobs had the' nads They say we're young , don't watch TV They say the Internet is all we see But that's not true ; they've got it wrong See , all our shows are just two minutes long Hey I got YouTube I got YouTube And now , ladies and gentlemen , a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America -- the RIAA !
Young man , you were surfin' along And then , young man , you downloaded a song And then , dumb man , copied it to your' Pod Then a phone call came to tell you ... You've just been sued by the R-I-A-A You've just been screwed by the R-I-A-A Their attorneys say you committed a crime And there'd better not be a next time They've lost their minds at the R-I-A-A Justice is blind at the R-I-A-A You're depriving the bands You are learning to steal You can't do whatever you feel CD sales have dropped every year They're not greedy , they're just quaking with fear Yes indeedy , what if their end is near And we download all our music Yeah , that would piss off the R-I-A-A No plastic discs from the R-I-A-A What a way to make friends It's a plan that can't fail All your customers off to jail Who'll be next for the R-I-A-A ? What else is vexing the R-I-A-A ? Maybe whistling a tune Maybe humming along Maybe mocking' em in a song
I don't understand myself , why they keep talking of love , if they come near me , if they look into my eyes and kiss my hand . I don't understand myself , why they talk of magic , that no one withstands , if he sees me , if he passes by . But if the red light is on in the middle of the night and everybody listens to my song , then it is plain to see . My lips , they give so fiery a kiss , my limbs , they are supple and white . It is written for me in the stars , thou shalt kiss , thou shalt love . My feet , they glide and float , my eyes , they lure and glow . And I dance as if entranced ,' cause I know , my lips give so fiery a kiss . In my veins , runs a dancer's blood , because my beautiful mother was the Queen of dance in the gilded Alcazar . She was so very beautiful , I often saw her in my dreams . If she beat the tambourine to her beguiling dance , all eyes were glowing admiringly . She reawakened in me , mine is the same lot . I dance like her at midnight and from deep within I feel : My lips , they give so fiery a kiss , my limbs , they are supple and white . It is written for me in the stars , thou shalt kiss , thou shalt love . And I dance as if entranced ,' cause I know , my lips give so fiery a kiss .

You must know someone like him He was tall and strong and lean With a body like a greyhound and a mind so sharp and keen But his heart , just like laurel grew twisted around itself Till almost everything he did brought pain to someone else It's not just what you're born with It's what you choose to bear It's not how big your share is It's how much you can share It's not the fights you dreamed of It's those you really fought It's not what you've been given It's what you do with what you've got What's the use of two strong legs if you only run away ? And what's the use of the finest voice if you've nothing good to say ? What's the use of strength and muscle if you only push and shove ? And what's the use of two good ears if you can't hear those you love ? What's the use of two strong legs if you only run away ? And what's the use of the finest voice if you've nothing good to say ? What's the use of strength and muscle if you only push and shove ? And what's the use of two good ears if you can't hear those you love ? Between those who use their neighbors and those who use the cane Between those in constant power and those in constant pain Between those who run to glory and those who cannot run Tell me which ones are the cripples and which ones touch the sun Which ones touch the sun Which ones touch the sun Thank you very much .

We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture , just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED , and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness . What I was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness -- or happiness , which I equate with joy in my particular area , and I think there's something very fundamental . And I was thinking about this . And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way . You go see a movie . And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and you find a joyful experience . You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect . And there's something joyful about it . And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things . So , what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way . I mean , sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant , but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way , in a very primal way , so I can make the audience here happy .
Where do we go from here ? How do we carry on ? I can't get beyond the questions Clambering for the scraps in the shatter of us , collapsed It cuts me with every could have been Pain on pain on play , repeating With the backup , makeshift life in waiting Everybody says time heals everything What of the wretched hollow ? The endless in between ? Are we just going to wait it out ? There is nothing to see here now Turning the sign around We're closed to the Earth' til further notice A crumbling cliche case crumpled and puffy faced caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles All I want , only one street level miracle I'll be an out and out born again from none more cynical Everybody says that time heals everything But what of the wretched hollow ? The endless in between ? Are we just going to wait it out ? And sit here cold ? We will be long gone by then In lackluster In dust we lay around old magazines Fluorescent lighting sets the scene for all we could and should be being in the one life that we've got Everybody says time heals everything And what of the wretched hollow ? The endless in between ? Are we just going to wait it out ? Just going to sweat it out ? Just going to sweat it out ? Wait it out
It's all there in gospels A Magdalene girl comes to pay her respects But her mind is awhirl When she finds the tomb empty Straw had been rolled Not a sign of a corpse In the dark and the cold When she reaches the door Sees an unholy sight There's a solitary figure and a halo of light He just carries on floating past Calvary Hill In an Almighty hurry Aye , but she might catch him still Tell me where are you gone , Lord And why in such haste ? Oh don't hinder me , woman I've no time to waste For they're launching a boat on the morrow at noon And I have to be there before daybreak Oh I cannot be missing The lads'll expect me Why else would the Good Lord Himself resurrect me ? For nothing'll stop me . I have to prevail Through the teeth of this tempest In the mouth of a gale May the angels protect me If all else should fail And the last ship sails Oh the roar of the chains And the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails So I was born and raised in the shadow of a shipyard in a little town on the northeast coast of England .
You see these work boots in my hands They'll probably fit you now , my son Take them , they're a gift from me Why don't you try them on ? It would do your old man good to see You walking in these boots one day And take your place among the men Who work upon the slipway These dead man's boots , though they're old and curled When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world And it's time for a man to put down roots And walk to the river in his old man's boots He said , " I'm dying , son , and asking That you do one final thing for me You're barely but a sapling , and you think that you're a tree If you need a seed to prosper You must first put down some roots Just one foot then the other in These dead man's boots " These dead man's boots , though they're old and curled When a fellow needs a job and a place in the world And it's time for a man to put down roots And walk to the river in his old man's boots I said , " Why in the hell would I do that ? Why would I agree ? " When his hand was all that I'd received As far as I remember It's not as if he'd spoiled me with his kindness Up to then , you see I'd a plan of my own and I'd quit this place When I came of age September These dead man's boots know their way down the hill They could walk there themselves , and they probably will I've plenty of choices , I've plenty other routes And you'll never see me walking in these dead man's boots What was it made him think I'd be happy ending up like him When he'd hardly got two halfpennies left Or a broken pot to piss in ? He wanted this same thing for me Was that his final wish ? He said , " What the hell are you gonna do ? " I said , " Anything but this ! " These dead man's boots know their way down the hill They can walk there themselves and they probably will But they won't walk with me' cause I'm off the other way I've had it up to here , I'm gonna have my say When all you've got left is that cross on the wall I want nothing from you , I want nothing at all Not a pension , nor a pittance , when your whole life is through Get this through your head , I'm nothing like you I'm done with all the arguments , there'll be no more disputes And you'll die before you see me in your dead man's boots Thank you .
Aye , the footmen are frantic in their indignation You see the queen's took a taxi herself to the station Where the porters , surprised by her lack of royal baggage Bustle her and three corgis to the rear of the carriage For the train it is crammed with all Europe's nobility And there's none of them famous for their compatibility There's a fight over seats " I beg pardon , Your Grace But you'll find that one's mine , so get back in your place ! " " Aye , but where are they going ? " All the porters debate " Why they're going to Newcastle and they daren't be late For they're launching a boat on the Tyne at high tide And they've come from all over , from far and from wide " There's the old Dalai Lama And the pontiff of Rome Every palace in Europe , and there's nay bugger home There's the Duchess of Cornwall and the loyal Prince of Wales Looking crushed and uncomfortable in his top hat and tails Well , they haven't got tickets Come now , it's just a detail There was no time to purchase and one simply has to prevail For we'll get to the shipyards or we'll end up in jail ! When the last ship sails Oh the roar of the chains And the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails And whatever you'd promised Whatever you've done And whatever the station in life you've become In the name of the Father , in the name of the Son And no matter the weave of this life that you've spun On the Earth or in Heaven or under the Sun When the last ship sails Oh the roar of the chains And the cracking of timbers The noise at the end of the world in your ears As a mountain of steel makes its way to the sea And the last ship sails Thanks very much for listening to my song .

Oh , I'm in love with the janitor's boy , And the janitor's boy is in love with me . Oh , I'm in love with the janitor's boy , And the janitor's boy is in love with me . He's going to hunt for a desert isle In our geography . A desert isle with spicy trees Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay ; A right nice place , just fit for two Where we can live always . Oh , I'm in love with the janitor's boy , And the janitor's boy , he's busy as can be ; Down in the cellar he's making a raft Out of an old settee . He'll carry me off , I know that he will , For his hair is exceedingly red ; And the only thing that occurs to me Is to dutifully shiver in bed . And on the day that we sail , I will leave a little note For my parents I hate to annoy : " I have flown to an island in the bay With my janitor's red haired-boy . " The janitor's red-haired boy The janitor's red-haired boy The janitor's red-haired boy The janitor's red-haired boy I'm going to sail away Gone to Sheepshead Bay With my janitor's red-haired boy . On an old settee My red-haired boy and me The janitor's red-haired boy . The janitor's red-haired boy The janitor's red-haired boy The janitor's red-haired boy The janitor's red-haired boy The next poem is by E.E. Cummings , " Maggie and Milly and Molly and May . "
Strung in the wind I called you but you did not hear ... And you're a plant that needs poor soil and I have treated you too well to give up flowers ... Oh , I have been too rich for you ... Farther than the sun from me Farther than I'd have you be And I go north , I get so cold My heart is lava under stone You are not worthy You are not worthy ... With your calculating eyes spinning figures you cannot see me You cannot see me ... And if I tell myself enough I'll believe it You are not worthy The sea , it freezes over ... to trap the light And I'm in love with being in love and you were never quite the one In Gerda's eyes Fragments of what you've become And all the moths that fly at night believe electric light is bright You are not worthy You are not worthy With your calculating eyes Spinning figures You cannot see me , no And if I tell myself enough I'll believe it You are not worthy Farther than the sun from me Farther than I'd have you be And I go north , I get so cold My heart is lava under stone You are not worthy You are not worthy With your calculating eyes Spinning figures You cannot see me , no ... And if I tell myself enough , I'll believe it Thank you very much .
You with the sad eyes Don't be discouraged Oh , I realize It's hard to take courage In a world full of people You can lose sight of it all And the darkness inside you Can make you feel so small But I see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow Show me a smile , then Don't be unhappy Can't remember when I last saw you laughing If this world makes you crazy And you've taken all you can bear You can call me up Because you know I'll be there And I'll see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow If this world makes you crazy You can call me up Because you know I'll be there And I'll see your true colors Shining through I see your true colors And that's why I love you So don't be afraid to let them show Your true colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow So don't be afraid to let them show True colors True colors True colors True colors are beautiful Like a rainbow

Me ! If Emma never rescued me ? What would I be ? What would I be ? Another starving refugee I remember the time when I was small When I couldn't read or write at all Now I'm all grown up , I got my education The sky is the limit and I can't be stopped by no one How I prayed for this day to come And I pray that the world find wisdom To give the poor in need some assistance Instead of putting up resistance , yeah Sitting and waiting for the politics to fix this It ain't gonna happen They're all sitting on they asses Popping champagne and sponging off the masses Coming from a refugee boy-soldier But I still got my dignity I gotta say it again If Emma never rescued me I'd be a corpse on the African plain Is there anybody who's here in the back , some love .
